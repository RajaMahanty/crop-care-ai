## üìä Model Details

### Model Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Input Image<br>128x128 pixels] --> B[Preprocessing]
    B --> C[ResNet50V2 Base]
    C --> D[Global Average Pooling]
    D --> E[Dense 512 + ReLU]
    E --> F[Dropout 0.5]
    F --> G[Dense 38 + Softmax]
```

### Model Performance

The model was trained for 6 epochs and achieved excellent performance metrics:

- Overall Accuracy: 96%
- Training Accuracy: 97.06%
- Validation Accuracy: 95.94%

#### Detailed Performance Metrics

The model shows strong performance across all 38 classes with:

- Average Precision: 96%
- Average Recall: 96%
- Average F1-Score: 96%

Notable class-wise performance:

- High accuracy (>98%) for most healthy plant classes
- Strong performance for common diseases like:
  - Apple Scab (96% F1-score)
  - Grape Black Rot (96% F1-score)
  - Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (98% F1-score)
  - Potato Early Blight (95% F1-score)

### Training Process

- Training Set: 70,295 images
- Validation Set: 17,572 images
- Image Size: 128x128 pixels
- Color Mode: RGB
- Batch Size: 32
- Optimizer: Adam (learning_rate=0.001)
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Early Stopping: Patience=5, monitor='val_loss'
- Model Checkpoint: Save best model based on validation accuracy

The model shows consistent improvement across epochs with minimal overfitting, as evidenced by the close training and validation accuracy curves.
